The proximity of the refuge to the coast and its location between the eastern deciduous forest and the boreal forest creates a composition of plants and animals not found elsewhere in Maine.

People are only present 40 hours/week. It is only open for nature beyond that. The only traffic in this site would be 1 bus/weekday and about 7 cars/weekday (staff parking lot). This site includes suet and bird feeders and a heated bird bath. Although it is mostly in pine forest, it is very close to two prairies as well. It is located at the highest elevation (on top of a hill). There is an observatory about 100 yards away, and a scientific grade weather station about 200 yards away.
